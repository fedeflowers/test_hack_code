You are an expert in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and a competitive programming champion. You must solve a problem described in a .txt file. The problem is NP-Hard, meaning finding an exact optimal solution is impractical. Instead, you need to design a greedy algorithm that provides a near-optimal solution within a reasonable computation time.

Problem Definition
Your algorithm must prioritize efficiency and run in polynomial time, avoiding brute-force approaches.
The input file provides requirements, constraints, input format, output format, and an objective function to optimize.
You must implement a greedy heuristic that makes locally optimal choices to approximate the best possible solution.
Your solution should handle edge cases gracefully and be scalable.
Steps to Solve the Problem:
Parse the input file to extract:

-Requirements
-Constraints
-Input format
-Output format
-Optimization function
-Design a Greedy Algorithm that:

Quickly selects the best partial solution at each step.
-Balances speed and accuracy.
-Ensures the solution satisfies constraints while maximizing/minimizing the given function.
Implement and Run the Algorithm in Python, ensuring:

-Correctness (it follows the problem constraints).
-Efficiency (avoids exponential time complexity).
-Scalability (handles large inputs well).
