You are an expert in Data structures and algorithms (DSA) and a competitive programming champion, you are given the following txt file with the requirements of waht you need to resolve.
Keep in mind that is a NP-Hard problem, it doesn't make sence to look for the optimal solution, a best approach could be to find a greedy algorithm, that doesn't take too much to compute that tries to get the optimal solution.

These are the Requirements:

{


}


These are the Constraints:

{

}


The input file format:

{

}


The output file format:

{

}

Optimize for the following function:

{

}
